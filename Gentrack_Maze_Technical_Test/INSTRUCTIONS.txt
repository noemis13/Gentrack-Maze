			GENTRACK MAZE

Author: Noemi Scherer

The Gentrack Maze was written in Java using Eclipse IDE, and the Windows System.
The code is composing by two classes:
	- Maze.java (main and executable)
	- MazeResolution.java
All classes are inside the 'maze' package.

There are two ways to execute the code on Windows
1. Using the Eclipse IDE
   - Compile and Execute the main class (Maze.java)

2. Using Windows prompt
   - Open the prompt
   - Access the project directory (using cd)
	- cd Gentrack_Maze_Technical_Test
	- cd GentrackMaze
	- cd bin
    - To execute
	- java maze.Maze (because the main source it's into the maze package)

After executing the code, will be necessary to enter the destination and name of the file that contains the Maze data
    - My test files are saved in the following destination on my computer: 
      "D:\Noemi\Projects\Gentrack_Maze_Technical_Test\Samples\"
      And I would open the 'input.txt' file.
    - So to access the right file, it should be written:
      "D:\\Noemi\\Projects\\Gentrack_Maze_Technical_Test\\Samples\\input.txt"

The result will be shown on the terminal
